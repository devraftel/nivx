Develop a voice-first workout app that enables users to interact with their virtual trainer through voice commands. 

The proof of concept must do the following:
1. Enable user to interact with an AI agent through voice commands. 
2. Guide users through a workout. The agent should be able to maintain the context of the workout as the user moves through it.
3. The app must be able to interpret voice commands and invoke programmatic functions based on those commands. These functions might include things like setting a timer, playing music, or playing videos. The user should not have to interact with any UI on the screen to prompt a video like "Show me how to do an overhead squat".

Nice to have - integration with Apple Health kit so that we can start to develop functions that prompt the agent to respond to things like heartrate.
